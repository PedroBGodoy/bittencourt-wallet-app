# Wallet App

This app is a simple way to keep track of your transactions. For now I am developing it just for learning purpose.

## Built With

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - Native App
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Data Base
- [WalletApp Backend](https://github.com/PedroBGodoy/bittencourt-wallet-app-backend) - REST API(Authentication, AccessToken, DB Request)

## Notes

Removed Auth0 from this project.
